<h1>InventoryAssist</h1>
<p>A prototype of an inventory tracking tool that I made for the bakery I worked at for the spring and summer of 2020</p>

<h2>General Function</h2>
<p>This tool lets you supply a list of products and their ID numbers and maintains a running list of your current stock.
  <br>Additionally, you may add stock goals for each product, and InventoryAssist will give you a visual representation of where the current stock
  stands in relation to where you would like it, giving you a straighforward and convenient list of products and amounts you need to order
<br>
  <br>Note, this is only a prototype, and was designed for a certain implementation and use case. It also requires JavaFX to run.</p>
